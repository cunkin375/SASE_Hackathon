**Team Members:** `Jeremy W., Xiangtao Wu, Andrew Barsoum`

## ðŸ’¬ Elevator Pitch

`The first tusk-powered job search app tailored to college graduates.`

<!--
Keep it short and sweet. What's the one-sentence summary of your project?
Example: "An app that helps recent graduates find and manage side-hustles to build their skills and income."
-->

## What It Does

<!--
This is the spot for a GIF of your project in action! âœ¨
Pro-Tip: Use a free tool like Giphy Capture or Kap to record a short, silent GIF of your app's main features. It's the best way to show off your work.
-->

<!--
Use a bulleted list to describe the key features of your project. Be specific!
-->

- **Searches Jobs by Company, Job Position, or Location:** `Users can query the database for jobs from a specific company, job position, and location of the job. `

- **Filter by Pay and Pay Period:** `Users can filter jobs by either hourly or yearly wage and can specifiy a minimum pay threshold.`

- **Shows Jobs Based on User Filters:** `The API combines all provided filters to return only the jobs that matches the user's criteria.`

## How We Built It

<!--
List the technologies, frameworks, and APIs you used. This is a great way to show off your technical skills to judges and recruiters.
-->

- **Frontend:** `React`

- **Backend:** `Python, PostgreSQL`

- **APIs:** `FastAPI, SQLAlchemy`

- **Cloud Services**: AWS, Neon
## Challenges We Ran Into

<!--
Every project has challenges! This is a great place to show your problem-solving skills.

* Did you run into a tricky bug?

* Was it hard to use a new API?

* How did you overcome it?
-->

`One of the biggest challenges our team faced was that most of us were using the tools in this project for the first time. While some team members had some prior experience with certain tools, we had to quickly learn FastAPI, database querying, and how to integrate the backend with the frontend. Balancing learning new tech while building a working project made us work together closely and solve problems under the time constraints.`

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of

<!--
What are you most proud of?

* Did you learn a new technology?

* Did you build a feature that works perfectly?

* Did your team collaborate effectively?
-->

`Despite being new to most of the tools, our team successfully built a functional project from scratch. We not only learned how to write a frontend and backend and then integrate them, but we also learned to collaborate efficiently under tight deadlines. In the end, we had a working product, gained skills in FastAPI and database management, and strengthened our teamwork, all of which that can help us in our future projects. `

`We also managed to build and populate a database that communicates with an application's backend.`

## What We Learned

<!--
Hackathons are all about learning! What new skills or concepts did you learn during this project?
-->

`During this project, we learned how to write a frontend and backend and how to link them. We also learned how to import raw CSV data into a database. We learned how to write the backend with FastAPI and the frontend interface was built with React and Node.js to handle and display custom user input and output. We also gained experience with deploying and testing database queries efficiently, which improved our understanding of backend data flow and API design.`

## What's Next for
